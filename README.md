This PHP Laravel project is a job site for posting listings for Laravel developers. Users can view job listings, and authenticated users can create, edit, and delete listings. Laravel Blade was used to easily pass in values (see the "resources" > "views" folder for "blade.php" files). MySQL was used as the database. Laravel Valet was also used in development.

The Laravel tutorial by Traversy Media was followed, which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYyJ4PuL4pY
